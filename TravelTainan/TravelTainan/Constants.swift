    var infoArray = ["Chikan Lou, also known as Chikan Tower or Fort Provintia, is among the most important historic sites in Tainan City as well as all of Taiwan. It is also one of the prettiest. Two ornate stone and wood towers sit amongst the grounds of lovely gardens that include a koi fish pond and several statues. This includes nine stone turtles carrying large steles on their backs. The site is lovely anytime of day, but it is particularly impressive at dusk when the lights of the towers and garden are just coming into effect. On some evenings, small musical concerts grace the front lawn. The Chinese style towers are built on top of an old Dutch fort called Provintia. You can still see some of the original brick foundations of this fort in certain areas of the site. It would seem hard to believe now, but at the time of the Dutch, Fort Provintia was oceanfront property. The land to the northwest of Chikan Lou has been transformed due to natural silting and man-made landfill. When the hero of Taiwan, Zheng Chenggong (Koxinga), landed his army to take Taiwan from the Dutch, he used his ships to cut off the waters between Fort Provintia and Fort Zeelandia in Anping – a thought that seems impossible given the structure of modern Tainan.", "First completed in 1666, Tainan’s Confucian Temple is one of the oldest and most historically important buildings in Taiwan. It was built by Zheng Chenggong’s (Koxinga’s) son, Zheng Jing, under the advice of city administrator Chen Yonghua. The temple served as Taiwan’s first official school. Since its inception, the temple has undergone more than 30 renovations, but it still retains its historical integrity. It is, justifiably, one of Tainan’s premier tourist attractions. The current look and layout of the temple comes from the 1917 renovations done during the Japanese era, though many of the structures are much older. At the heart of temple is the main hall, known as Dacheng Hall. Its current look with a double-eave round hip roof dates back to 1719. It is surrounded by an enclosure of halls that connect to the greater temple grounds though Dacheng Gate. In front of Dacheng Gate is the main courtyard. Here, in addition to Banyan trees and open ground, we find two ceremonial gates known as the Li Gate and the Yi Path which symbolize the main disciplines of Confucianism.  In front of the central courtyard is the Pan Pond, a semi-circular stone pond that was also a site of ceremonial rituals. Next to Dacheng Hall is the Hall of Edification, or Minglun Hall, where you can find Confucian text displayed in beautiful calligraphy. Tucked in the corner behind Minglun Hall is the Wen Chang Pavilion, built in 1886 and very recently restored. This is a three story pavilion dedicated to the literature deity, Wen Chang. Surrounding this compound are great red walls. Two gates, known as East Dacheng Gate and West Dacheng Gate, allow access through these walls. The east gate sits on Nanmen Road, making it the main gate and a common symbol for the temple as a whole. Across Nanmen Road is the Pan Gao Stone Arch, which was added 1777.", "The goddess Matsu is one of the most important deities in Taiwan. It’s a simple equation, really: Goddess of the Sea + Taiwan being an island = high status among worshippers. Matsu was already important among the coastal Fujianese before crossing the straight, but the perilous journey from the mainland to Taiwan required a lot of prayers to the being in charge of the waves. There are estimates of over 400 or 500 Matsu temples in Taiwan, but one of the most sacred is right in downtown Tainan. Tainan Grand Matsu Temple (Dà Tiānhòu Gōng) was a palace before it was a temple. Zheng Chenggong’s (Koxinga’s) son, Zheng Jing, had it built for The Prince of Ningjing (Zhu Shugui) after inviting the Ming prince to take up residency in Taiwan. The palace was where the prince was living when he decided to take his own life, and it was in the main hall of this building that his five concubines hanged themselves from a wood beam. When the Qing took over Taiwan, General Shi Lang took up residency in the palace. Later, in a political move, he petitioned his emperor to have the building converted into a temple dedicated to Matsu.", "Unlike urban cemeteries in Europe where you can find people sitting next to grave stones and reading books, Taiwanese people are far too superstitious to treat a grave site as a park. The very idea of entering a cemetery for any purpose other than to clean the tomb and give respects to ancestors is close to sacrilege in Taiwan. This sentiment, however, doesn’t seem to be true for the tomb of five women who gave up their lives to honor their husband and their dynasty. The Temple of the Five Concubines, or Wǔfēi Miào, marks the grave of those women. It is in the center of a half-acre park that is well-used by locals and tourists alike. It is a good place to sit amongst the trees and read a book or catch up on gossip without having to give any thoughts to the five young ladies buried under yonder mound. But not everyone comes just to enjoy the park. This temple is often visited by those who want to honor the nobility of self-sacrifice. This is why it is also known as Temple of the Five Noble Ladies.", "If you live in or even visit Tainan, it should be required that you know who Zheng Chenggong is. His name is aligned to both the city and the very foundations of Taiwan. The city’s most central street and its most prestigious university are named after him (note there are a variety of spellings such as Jheng Cheng Kung), and you wouldn’t be able to read the text of any tourist site without seeing his name. There might be some confusion, however, because in most English writings he is known as Koxinga. This is a more internationally recognized name, but if you mention ‘Koxinga’ to Taiwanese people you will probably receive a blank stare. Mention Zheng Chenggong, however, and you might see their eyes light up with pride for their national hero. His name is very revered in Taiwanese culture and quite synonymous with success and ability. If you want to give praise to someone’s achievements, you could tell them they are very chénggōng. The name Koxinga is a mispronunciation of Guóxìngyé(國姓爺), a title meaning “Lord of the Imperial Surname” given to Zheng by the Ming emperor. Zheng Chenggong was a champion of the Ming in their struggle to maintain their dynasty against the surging Manchu Qing who would ultimately take over China and serve as its final dynasty before becoming a republic.", "The center of any visit to Anping is the old fort. Anping Fort is built on the foundations of the Dutch stronghold named Fort Zeelandia. That fort was the anchor point of early settlements in Tainan for both the Dutch and the Chinese, and much of the settlement’s history lies in Anping’s old streets surrounding the fort. The fort has changed hands and changed names many times over. The Dutch first called it Orlande, but then changed it to Fort Zeelandia. It became Anping Castle when it was the home of Zheng Chenggong (Koxinga). The Japanese called it the Old Dutch Fort just as they were demolishing what remained after decades of neglect. They then rebuilt the fort (sort of), and renamed it Anping Fort. The KMT began development of the tourist site you see now.", "Not long before Taiwan was handed over to Japan, this fort was built to increase defense against the threat of invasion from those very same Japanese. The Qing leadership began building the fortress in 1874 and completed it in 1876. They hired a French architect named Bordeaux to construct a modern fort that could defend the city from a sea attack. A spot was chosen along the coast not too far from the defunct Fort Zeelandia. Famously, bricks were taken from the remains of Fort Zeelandia for use in fort’s construction. This was the first modern-era fort built in Taiwan. Its three hectors consist of a square central field with large walls surrounding it. There are bastions at the four corners pushing out from the square design so that from above the fort looks like a square with a large “X” crossing through it. A moat surrounds the fort tracing its shape. The entrance is a large brick tunnel on the east side of the fort. At the tunnel entrance there was a wooden drawbridge that spanned the moat. The central field was a practice ground and contained a pond at one time. Under the fort was a kitchen, granary and ammunition depot. The fortress was equipped with British “Armstrong” cannons, making it the first fort in Taiwan with such modern artillery. Cannons were posted on each bastion and along the sea-facing wall. It had 5 eighty-ton, 4 forty-ton and 4 twenty-pound guns."]
